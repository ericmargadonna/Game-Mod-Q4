# Welcome to QuakeLanes!
QuakeLanes is a Quake 4 mod made for IT266 - Game Mod Development at the New Jersey Institute of Technology

## Introduction
This is a mod inspired by games like [Inscryption](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1092790/Inscryption/) and Adventure Time's 
[Card Wars](https://adventuretime.fandom.com/wiki/Card_Wars_(game)). This mod is a lane fighting, deck building, rougelike that 
you can play inside of your favorite Doom like FPS!

\*_This mod, as well as this readme, is a work in progress_

## Gameplay
QuakeLanes was designed from the beginning with the intent of keeping the entirety of Quake 4 playable. The story and maps are all 
unchanged. The only aspect of Quake 4 I wanted to change was the combat. When the player gives or recieves damage, the 
card game begins with the inflictor of the damage moving first. Turns are then taken with each side having 2 actions 
per turn. With a single action, players can place a card, move a card, or bring a card back to your hand. In between each 
turn, every played card attacks the lane across from them. Your goal is to bring all of the oppononent's card's healths
down to zero. If you can do this, all of the enemies die in the game and you can move on to the next ones. If, however, 
all of your cards get reduced to 0 health, the enemies around you that took part in the game still die, but you also
lose 1/4th of your health. This means that after 4 losses, you are dead, and must return to the beginning of the game. 
But becuase of the rougelike inspiration of this mod, you keep a card or two from your previous life.
